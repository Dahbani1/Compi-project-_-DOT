## **COMPI Project**  
**Team:** Mohammed Dahbani & Mahmoud Mokrane  

### **Description**  
This project implements an optimal transport (OT)-based pipeline for image processing. It includes an offline training phase and an inference phase.

### **DOT Pipeline**  

#### **1- Training Phase (Offline Phase)**  
1. **Encode images**  
2. **Compute the OT operator**  
3. **Apply the OT transformer**  

#### **2- Inference Phase**  
This phase leverages pre-trained models to perform predictions on new images.  

### **Tests**  
Tests are conducted using a pre-trained VAE, as described in a research paper.  
- **Paired images**  
- **Unpaired images**  

### **Installation & Usage**  
*(Add instructions here for installing dependencies and running the pipeline, based on the notebook content.)*
