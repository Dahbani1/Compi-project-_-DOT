### **Project Overview**  
This project implements an **Optimal Transport (OT)-based pipeline** for image processing, focusing on **image restoration**. The workflow consists of an **offline training phase** and an **inference phase** for testing.

The project is structured around two main Jupyter notebooks:
- **`DOT.ipynb`**: Implements the OT pipeline and testing phase.
- **`Dataset.ipynb`**: Prepares the dataset used for training and testing.

### **Dataset Preparation**  
The dataset consists of images categorized into different folders for training and testing:

#### **Training Data (Offline Phase Input)**  
Organized into **six folders**, containing :
- **10 clean images** (original high-quality images) (2 folders)
- **10 noisy images** (Gaussian noise applied) (2 folders)
- **10 restored images** (Gaussian blur applied for denoising) (2 folders)

#### **Testing Data (Inference Phase Input)**  
Organized into **three separate folders**:
- **Clean test image**
- **Noisy test image**
- **Restored test image**

### **DOT Pipeline**  
The DOT (Deep Optimal Transport) pipeline consists of two main phases:

#### **1- Training Phase (Offline Phase)**  
1. **Encode Images**: Extracts feature representations from images.
2. **Compute the OT Operator**: Learns the optimal transport mapping between noisy and clean images.

#### **2- Inference Phase (Testing Phase)** 
1. **Apply the OT Transformer**: Use the trained model to transform a new image based on the learned optimal transport mapping.  
2. **Visualize the results**: Display the transformed image to analyze qualitative performance.  
3. **Plot the perception-distortion curve**: Evaluate the model by testing different values of **Î±** and plotting the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion.

### **Testing Approach**  
We evaluate the pipeline using a **pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** (stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-ema). The testing includes:
- **Paired image testing**: Using corresponding noisy and clean images.
- **Unpaired image testing**: Testing on unseen images to evaluate generalization.
